#### Usage of srpw_template filter

Add a "views" directory and file named "custom-srpw.php" to your template directory. The "custom-srpw.php" file will be your custom template for this example.

#### Example of using a custom template from within your theme pre-PHP 5.3



    `<?php

    function customize_srpw_template_filter( $template ){
        $template_dir = get_template_directory();
        return $template_dir . '/views/custom-srpw.php';    
    }
    add_filter( 'srpw_template', 'customize_srpw_template_filter' );
    ?>`


#### Example of using a custom template from within your theme PHP 5.3+ which allows anonymous functions

    `<?php

    add_filter( 'srpw_template', function ( $template ){
        $template_dir = get_template_directory();
        return $template_dir . '/views/custom-srpw.php';    
    } );
    ?>`

#### Grunt

This plugin takes advantage of Grunt for validating JavaScript, SASS compilation and minification. To take advantage of Grunt you have to have both [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed. Visit the respective sites for the applications and make sure they are installed. Once installed, if you want to edit/fork this plugin, it will be helpful to be familiar with these two tools.


== Installation ==

1. If installing manually, unzip and copy the resulting directory to your plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Add the widget to any widgetized area/sidebar and configure as desired.
